<h1>MetaOpt: Metaheuristic Optimization Dashboard for Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<h3>MetaOpt is a web-based dashboard designed to streamline the hyperparameter tuning process for machine learning models. Leveraging metaheuristic optimization algorithms like Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Simulated Annealing, MetaOpt provides an efficient solution for model tuning across various tasks, such as classification, regression, and clustering. The dashboard supports different data types (tabular, text, and image) and aims to reduce the time and resources needed for model optimization.</h3>
